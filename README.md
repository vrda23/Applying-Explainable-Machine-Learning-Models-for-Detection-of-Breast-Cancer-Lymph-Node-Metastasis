# Applying-Explainable-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-Lymph-Node-Metastasis
This repository contains the experimentations and code utilized for the study "Applying Explainable Machine Learning Models for Detection of Breast Cancer Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients Eligible for Neoadjuvant Treatment"


This project focuses on training and validating several machine learning algorithms with the purpose of accurately classifying breast cancer lymph node metastasis using only clincopathological data.

NOTE: Data used in this study is still used in other ongoing studies and hence not yet available.

The work from this repository was published in a peer-reviewed journal Cancers (MDPI) and is available at: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/3/634.

The *target* variable is the presence of lymph node metastasis (0/1), while the predicitve features used for model training are: 
- patient age (in years)
- tumour size (in cm)
- tumour grade (1-3)
- histological type (NOS-invasive, Lobular Invasive, Ca with medullary characteristics, Other (Rare Types))
- immunophenotype (Luminal A, Luminal B, Triple-negative, Her2 positive, Luminal-B-Her2-positive)
- ER (estrogen receptors) (0-100)
- PR (progesteron receptors) (0-100)
- HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptors) (0-3)
- Ki-67 (index of cellular proliferation) (0-100)
